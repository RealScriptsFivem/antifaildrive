## Configuration
### Notifications
The script uses `ox_lib` for notifications. Replace `mdc.notify` in `client.lua` to customize the notify function.

```lua
mdc.notify = function(xType, message, duration)
    lib.notify({type = xType, description = message, duration = duration or 5000})
end
```

### Settings
| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `mdc.explosionChance` | Chance (in percentage) for the engine explosion to occur after severe damage. Default: `100` |
| `mdc.completeExplosionChance` | Chance for a complete vehicle explosion after the engine is destroyed. Default: `100` |
| `mdc.wheels` | Function to determine how many wheels break. Default: `math.random(1, 4)` (random) |
| `mdc.waitTime` | Wait time for the main loop (in milliseconds). Default: `100` |
| `mdc.excluded` | Table to list excluded vehicles by their model names. Example: `["rmod7"] = true` |

---

## Example Excluded Vehicles
```lua
mdc.excluded = {
    ["rmod7"] = true,
    ["rebel"] = true,
    ["zentorno"] = true,
}
```
